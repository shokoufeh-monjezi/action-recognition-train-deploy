# Train TAO Action Recognition using Quick Deploy


## Action recognition using TAO ActionRecognitionNet
The NVIDIA TAO Toolkit is a simple, AI training toolkit which uses transfer learning to train on while simultaneously simplifying the model training process and optimizing the model for inference throughput on the target platform. The result is an ultra-streamlined workflow. Take your own models or pre-trained models, adapt them to your own real or synthetic data, then optimize for inference throughput. All without needing AI expertise or large training datasets.

Transfer learning is the process of transferring learned features from one application to another. It is a commonly used training technique where you use a model trained on one task and re-train to use it on a different task.

TAO Toolkit is a simple and easy-to-use Python based AI toolkit for taking purpose-built AI models and customizing them with users' own data.

About Quick Deploy
The quick deploy feature automatically sets up the Vertex AI instance with an optimal configuration, preloads the dependencies, runs the software from NGC without any need to set up the infrastructure.

## Get Started with TAO:
To help you get started, we have created a sample Jupyter Notebook that can be easily deployed on Vertex AI using NGC’s quick deploy feature. This feature automatically sets up the Vertex AI instance with an optimal configuration, preloads the dependencies, runs the software from NGC without any need to set up the infrastructure.

Simply click on the button that reads “Deploy to Vertex AI” and follow the instructions.

Note: A customized kernel for the Jupyter Notebook is used as the primary mechanism for deployment. This kernel has been built on the TAO Toolkit container. For more information on the container itself, please refer to this link for more information:

The container version: nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit:4.0.0-pyt
